# LUENN
Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy (__SMLM__) has expanded our ability to visualize sub-cellular structures but is limited in its temporal resolution. <br>
Here we present a deep-convolutional neural network, called LUENN, which utilizes a unique architecture that rejects the isolated emitter assumption. LUENN is a deep CNN based Python package that takes advantages of [Tensorflow](http://tensorflow.org/) tool for single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). It has high accuracy for a large range of imaging modalities and frame densitie. <br>
