# LUENN
__Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) has expanded our ability to visualize sub-cellular structures but is limited in its temporal resolution. Increasing emitter density will improve temporal resolution, but current analysis algorithms struggle as emitter images significantly overlap. Here we present a deep-convolutional neural network called LUENN which utilizes a unique architecture that rejects the isolated emitter assumption.
