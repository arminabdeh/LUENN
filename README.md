## LUENN
__Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) has expanded our ability to visualize sub-cellular structures but is limited in its temporal resolution. Increasing emitter density will improve temporal resolution, but current analysis algorithms struggle as emitter images significantly overlap.__ <br>
Here we present a deep-convolutional neural network called LUENN which utilizes a unique architecture that rejects the isolated emitter assumption. LUENN is a Python and [Tensorflow](http://tensorflow.org/) based deep learning tool for single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). It has high accuracy for a large range of imaging modalities and frame densitie.
